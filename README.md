# IFX_ODIN
Ontology and Data Integration Network

We are currently enhancing our data integration capabilities (NCATS and other open-source biomedical datasets) by transitioning from traditional relational databases to an interoperable graph database using the Neo4j platform, structured around the BioLink Data Model, https://github.com/ncats/IFX_ODIN. This integration seamlessly incorporates comprehensive gene/protein information, disease associations, and drug data, enabling more advanced AI/ML applications. A public Neo4j instance is coming soon.For more information about our initiatives or to collaborate, please contact Jessica Maine or Keith Kelleher
